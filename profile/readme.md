Just walked outta the theater and holy moly, my brain's doing somersaults. Lilo & Stitch... where do I even start? Okay, picture this: chaos. But not like my Sunday morning, more like a tropical cyclone wrapped in sci-fi. I mean, it's a freaking alien POW in a beachy Hawaiian setting! Who came up with that combo? Someone who clearly skipped their meds or took too many. 

Lilo's this little peanut with a sass that's almost as big as her heart. She's dragging around this photograph of Pudge the fish, who she claims controls the weather. Kind of like my uncle thinking his BBQ summon storms. Stitch? Oh man, he's a stitched-up Frankenstein furball on a cosmic mission. But guess what, he’s also kinda the heart of the movie in a strangest way possible. Who knew a pet that's basically a weapon of mass destruction could be so damn... adorable?

> I'm pretty sure I got a few concerned looks from parents while howling at some of this madness, but whatever, my social anxiety can deal with it later. The mishmash of cultural vibes, pineapple-scented sunburnt love, and alien mischief is like if E.T. crash-landed during a tiki party. The movie’s asking some big questions here: What is family, and why's it always so imperfectly perfect, or perfectly imperfect. Whichever comes first... ugh, words.

One minute, tears threaten, next I'm just itching to download the movie, watch it again and try to figure out if I'd ever want a 626 in my life. I mean, it's kinda like having a perpetual toddler and a small hurricane as a pet. Speaking of mess, there's this sisterhood thing going on that's way too real. Nani and Lilo are playing the we're fine game like champs despite literally drowning in life's bat-crap troubles. And oh, that Elvis soundtrack? Consider my socks knocked off.

Random sidenote — what's up with Stitch thinking he's the King himself? I guess if you've got extra limbs, you reckon you can swing your hips better than Presley.  

```csharp
public int AdoptedMemberCount(List<Alien> alienFamily)
{
    return alienFamily.Where(a => a.IsAcceptedByLilo).Count();
}
```

So yeah, maybe I'm semi-exhausted and a teensy bit annoyed ‘cause I'm having too many feelings right now. Overall though, Lilo & Stitch does a number on you. It's this wild, out of control ride, but sometimes you gotta hop on, let the sand cast its spell and just feel... whatever it is. Just... don't expect things to fit neatly in the box, life ain’t wrapped up with a pretty bow, or an alien.
